CONTINUING PROGRESS,
TOGETHER !
A STRONG PLAN FOR A SUSTAINABLE CITY
ELECTORAL PLATFORM 2017-2021

Dear friends,
If the last four years have proven anything, it’s that by working together, nothing is impossible.
Since my arrival at City Hall, each of our many achievements has been the result of a strong
commitment from elected officials who have teamed up with me, community leaders and those
from the Montréal civil society. Everyone agreed that Montréal needed a fresh start and put in
effort and hard work to effect real change.
Moreover, the number of new projects, programs and policies developed by my administration
during our first term is simply impressive. This is proof that there was a huge gap to fill.
That is why we must ensure our dreams and our actions are not only reaffirmed but also realized
over the next four years. We must continue the work. And there is much to do.
By electing our team to Montréal City Hall in 2013, you pointed out that we must break with the
past and build for the future ; that it was necessary to make Montréal a city for all Montrealers, an
inclusive city where no one is left behind. A city living and thriving together.
You told us we should encourage economic development, but not at any cost. Not to the detriment
of sustainable development and a sense of community. These three ideas have now become inseparable.
You asked us to repair the city and to beautify it, while preserving the attractiveness of its boroughs,
neighbourhoods and living environments. You wanted to make Montréal a metropolis, but on a
human scale—keeping its citizens in mind.
Finally, you told us that you wanted Montréal to take back its leadership role, to intervene on issues
and decisions that affect us in Quebec City and Ottawa. You wanted us to take part in issues that
affect major cities around the world.
Today, Montréal has regained its vigor, its boldness and its determination to surpass itself. My
team is ready to commit again, both at City Hall and in every borough of our great city.
Let’s keep working, together !
Denis Coderre
Mayor of Montréal

MONTRÉAL :
A REDISCOVERED
SENSE OF PRIDE
Montréal is not the same city today as it was four years ago. Not only is it experiencing an
unprecedented economic recovery, but other, much deeper changes are transforming it
into an unavoidable metropolis.
When we arrived in office, we had a big job to do : rebuild Montréal’s credibility, repair the mistakes
of the past and restore a solid financial state to be able to concentrate on the future in the short,
medium and long term.
In less than four years, we have achieved what others take decades to accomplish. Is the job
done? Far from it. But the foundation has been laid as the metropolis of Quebec : to be a dynamic
city, to play its full role and contribute to the economic, social and sustainable development of
Quebec.
                                                                          3

TORGETHER FOR INTEGRATED AND

RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT
In November 2013, one of the major concerns Montrealers had was the elimination of corruption
and collusion in the bidding process and the awarding of municipal contracts. One of our very
first actions was to create the Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ), headed by Denis Gallant.
Since then, the OIG has been constantly monitoring the integrity of the municipal apparatus.
At the same time, we focused our efforts on improving the finances of the city of Montréal by
slowing growth in spending, while keeping tax increases below the rate of inflation. As a result, the
proportion of the budget allocated for salaries and benefits decreased from 51% of the city’s total
budget in 2014 to 44% in 2017. This tight control of expenditures allowed the city to generate the
necessary financial leeway for a major reinvestment in our infrastructure ( roadways, aqueducts
and sewers ). This responsible approach had a direct and immediate impact on Montreal’s credit
rating, which was upgraded from A + to AA-.

TOGETHER FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A
2
HUMAN-SCALE CITY AND THE UPGRADING OF
INFRASTRUCTURE IN ITS NEIGHBOURHOODS
We have executed and initiated major urban redevelopments since 2013 that have
completely transformed Montréal. For example, the demolition of the Bonaventure
Expressway and its transformation into Robert-Bourassa Boulevard, now lined with
masterpieces of public art. This new entrance to the city centre is worthy of the biggest
and best cities in the world.
Montréal’s 375th anniversary was a unique opportunity for Montréal and the governments of
Quebec and Canada to invest significant amounts of money in legacy projects that will serve
future generations. This includes the recovery of the Ville-Marie highway, which will correct a
major developmental error by connecting Old Montréal with the rest of the city. In a few years,
a new square, the Place des Montréalaises, will bridge the gap between two portions of the city
separated for decades. Not far from there, we began the redevelopment of Square Viger to
make it safer, while respecting the memory and the work of Charles Daudelin, one of the greatest
pioneers of the integration of public art in Quebec. Everyone will be able to enjoy this unique
urban space on a human scale.
We also began the process of rebuilding and redeveloping Sainte-Catherine Street. This iconic
commercial street will regain its luster in the second mandate and will be served by the Metropolitan
Power Network, which will have two stations in the city centre.
To support the development of the downtown core over the next 10 years, we have developed
our Downtown Strategy, which reflects our vision of a place to live, work and do business ( see box ).
THE DOWNTOWN STRATEGY
Montréal’s downtown is experiencing extraordinary momentum, both in terms of
demographics and economics, but also with respect to culture and in real estate.
Thanks to the civic participation of Montrealers, we have defined the course that
will guide its development over the next few years :
•   Increase transit offerings to the downtown core by 100,000 trips per day ;
•   Transform the areas located at the entrances of the city into dynamic and open
neighbourhoods on the river : the areas of Papineau-Pied-du-Courant ( East ) and the
Peel-Bridge-Wellington Basin area ( West ) ;
•   Implement four new primary schools and a new public secondary school ;
•   Add 1,000 units of three or more bedrooms to the downtown core, a significant
proportion of which will be affordable for first time home buyers, including families.
                                                                         6

Alongside these major projects, our administration has taken on its responsibilities in the face
of a less joyful challenge. For decades, our basic infrastructure has suffered from dramatic
underinvestment. We decided to tackle the issues rather than postpone the problem. As such,
5,100 kilometers of roads and water pipelines are currently being, or will be upgraded in the
next ten years. We want to ensure that the city we build for our children will be a livable
one, with good infrastructure. We want the best for our kids and our neighbours ; we want all
Montrealers to inherit a city that is at its best.
We have worked to reduce the impact of these infrastructure projects on our residents and
tradespeople by improving our methods and planning, while introducing traffic mitigation
measures and site design innovations. The work has been evident, and the city will continue to
improve its practices to minimize impact on traffic.
                                                                   7

TOGETHER FOR SOCIAL COHESION AND

LIVING TOGETHER
Infrastructure projects and large public squares don’t t make sense if citizens and their ability
to live together are not central to the concerns of municipal government. During the 2013-2017
mandate, we strived to develop policies and programs that we have pursued and will continue
to. Our achievements are numerous ( see box ) but we can achieve even more by continuing to
work together.

TOGETHER FOR A COMMITMENT TO A SOCIAL
4
AND ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP
The economic health of Montréal was extremely successful during our 2013-2017 mandate.
An administration must put in place conditions for economic growth, which we have worked very
hard to do. In addition, we have ensured that economic growth is made to serve the well-being
of citizens by creating a genuine social partnership through progressive, bold, responsible and
sustainable policies.
The unemployment rate, at 8%, is at a historic low for the last 30 years. When we better integrate
newcomers into the labour market, particularly through prior learnings and measures put in
place by the city, we will achieve full employment ( estimated at 4% ). In addition to historically
low unemployment rates, the number of people employed in 2017 is up 5.2% compared to 2016,
with the creation of 51,000 jobs, of which 34,400 are full-time jobs.
Housing starts are also up, particularly in the commercial sector, with 14 new hotel projects
having been built or started. As tourism reaches historic highs, the construction of new hotels
demonstrates the confidence of investors and the response to a need that will continue after
the 375th anniversary festivities. As a result of rising demand, daily rates are rising.
Tourism ( up 4.6% in 2017 ), more notably the number of cruise passengers ( up 9.8% in 2017 )
is also rising sharply, and these figures are likely related to the increase in the number of direct
flights to Montréal. Eighteen new direct international flights have been added since the beginning
of 2016. Currently, Montréal has 85 international flights and others are expected to be added in
the coming years.
The value of non-residential construction permits is estimated at $289 million in July, an increase
of 93% from July 2016 primarily in the commercial, industrial and institutional sectors.
Vacancy rates for offices and industrial spaces are also declining, indicating that businesses are
doing well.
                                                                       9

TOGETHER FOR A SMART AND
5
TRANSPARENT CITY
Our goal is to continue to rebuild Montréal by adopting principles of an intelligent, open and
collaborative city ; a city that develops technological solutions to major urban issues. Since
its inception in 2014, our Smart and Digital City Office has implemented some thirty projects
aimed at improving municipal services, urban mobility, connectivity, citizen participation and
economic development. The basic mission of the Smart City Office is to put citizen-related
tools in place to develop the city of tomorrow. Digitization will also allow for a greater
participatory democracy and sustainable and efficient development in the future.
At the basis of this new philosophy is our open data policy, whereby Montréal shares all the
data it collects and allows it to be used for a variety of purposes, including commercial purposes :
photographic archives, bicycle counting and pedestrians, crime, parking. In short, more than
250 datasets are accessible on the city’s open data portal. By the end of 2018, more than 800
will be available.
This effort of transparency has given rise to several new tools that facilitate and encourage
citizen participation : «View of municipal contracts», «View of the budget», «View of public
security», for example. Similarly, we joined the Canadian Municipal Calibration Network to
publicly compare our performance to other Canadian cities.
                                                                       10

TOGETHER FOR AN
6
INTERNATIONAL METROPOLIS
Because of its demographic and economic weight, Montréal is the metropolis of Quebec and a major
international metropolis. As such, it has a locomotive effect on the Quebec economy provided it has
the necessary tools to fully play this role. This view is also shared by the Government of Quebec when
it adopted “Bill 121, Loi augmentant l’autonomie et les pouvoirs de la Ville de Montréal, métropole du
Québec, an act to increase the autonomy and powers of Ville de Montréal, the metropolis of Quebec,
on September 21, 2017. This gives us a greater margin to maneuver and greater autonomy to define
our priorities, as well as newfound power to shape resources for economic development.
This bill - as well as the «Reflexe Montréal» agreement, in which the government recognizes
Montréal’s contribution to the development of Quebec - represents a great victory for all
Montrealers. Our new metropolitan status already allows us to make important changes, notably in
terms of housing, family retention, immigrant integration and economic development. But beyond
these new powers, it allows us to look to the future hopeful, in a new partnership with the
Government of Quebec, knowing together we can work for the well-being of Montrealers
and all Quebeckers.
Montréal has also distinguished itself at the international level. Cities play a counterbalanced role in
what is known as international urban diplomacy. Montréal is a true city of international solidarity. It
has signed numerous agreements with major metropolises and bilateral agreements with Paris,
London, Shanghai, Seoul, Hiroshima, Chicago, Toronto and many others. It has also forged strong
links through important associations such as:
•  Metropolis
•  The International Association of Francophone Mayors ( AIMF )
•  United Cities and Local Governments ( UCLG )
•  C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group ( C40 )
•  International Council for Local Ecological Initiatives ( ICLEI )
•  The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative
                                                                           11

Along with other major cities, Montréal participated in the COP21 Climate Change Conference
in 2015, responding to the call from the United Nations. Big cities are now impossible to avoid
on the diplomatic level and Montréal plays its role.
Increased international presence also allows us to attract foreign investment, major international
events, students and tourists, contributing to the economic development of the metropolis.
During the last mandate, we carried out some fifteen economic missions abroad. Over the
same period, more than ten new direct air links have been established between Montréal
and metropolises such as Beijing, Tel Aviv, Lyon, Houston and Shanghai.
EXPANDING TOURISM
As a sign of the vitality of Montréal, our metropolis received more than
10.2 million visitors in 2016, a 3.5% increase over 2015. These tourists spent
$ 3.3 billion, up 5.8%. With the celebrations of the 375th anniversary, more
than 11 million tourists are expected in 2017.
                                                                     12

TOGETHER TO SUPPORT

CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT
The elected officials and the administration of the City of Montréal can rely on numerous advisory
bodies in their decision-making. In addition to the Montréal Public Consultation Office, we have
set up Concertation Montréal, an organization that provides broad direction in areas such as
knowledge and diversity, education and science, youth, governance and gender equality, social
economy, digital creativity, the environment and food systems. We have also strengthened the role
of the various advisory councils such as the Conseil des Montréalaises, the Youth Council, the
Intercultural Council and the Heritage Council. The Executive Committee undertook to formally
respond to all opinions submitted by these boards. Lastly, we promoted the creation of Youth
Councils in all the boroughs of Montréal to reinforce the consideration of the interests and vision of
our youth in decision-making. To date, three Youth Councils have been created in the boroughs of
Verdun, Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Pierrefonds-Roxboro, all three with a majority of Équipe Coderre
elected officials.
It is extremely difficult to say how many consultations were held during the last term in Montréal.
Countless upstream consultations have been conducted in the boroughs or in the city centre for
projects such as the redevelopment of parks and most of the projects carried out by Public Works.
These consultations are not counted or mandatory. There have also been follow-up meetings after
the completion of Public Works projects or with citizens’ round table discussions as part of the
projects set up by the Sport, Culture, Recreation and Social Development Directorate.

FIVE CHALLENGES
FOR MONTRÉAL
During our first term, we gave the necessary push to revive the city of Montréal. Over the next
few years we will continue our work by completing everything we have undertaken and focusing
more on five specific challenges :

1 ) LET’S CONTINUE TO LIVE BETTER IN THE CITY :
A METROPOLIS ON A HUMAN SCALE
Montréal is above all a multitude of boroughs, neighbourhoods and areas of life : that is what shapes
it its beauty and richness. Of course, we must ensure that municipal services are consistent from
one borough to another ( snow removal, collection of residual materials, etc. ). But a metropolis on a
human scale must consider neighbourhood life and make all efforts to promote it in terms of
leisure, social cohesion, economic growth and cultural vitality.
Thus, better “city living” is to be able to fully enjoy urban life, enjoying quality urban facilities, public
spaces, sports facilities, local shops, rich cultural activities and diverse, as well as efficient and
modern municipal services, worthy of a smart and digital city.
                                                                                14

2 ) LET’S CONTINUE BUILDING HOUSING AND BUILDING FAMILIES
One of the major achievements of our administration was the repatriation of control of housing
programs. The «Reflexe Montréal» agreement was signed with the Government of Quebec within
the framework of the metropolitan status, ensuring that the responsibility and budgets of the Quebec
Housing Corporation for the development of housing in our region is transferred to the City of
Montréal. This allows us to develop a housing policy that considers the many realities of our great
city.
These new powers translate into measures that benefit families by offering them a much more
generous home ownership program and housing types that are better suited to their needs. For the
first time in a long time, we have a powerful incentive to positively influence the decision of families
to buy a property in Montréal, particularly in downtown Montréal.
                                                                              16

Montréal by increasing both financial assistance, the type of eligible properties and the
maximum allowable prices * ;
•                                                                                                        Target not only first-time buyers, but also young families already owning, with children aged 5 and

developers on the type of housing that meets the needs of families * ;
•                                                                                                        Prioritize families in the development of new neighbourhoods such as the Triangle, Pierrefonds West

of non-compliances * .
3 ) LET’S CONTINUE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Montréal’s economic recovery is well underway. Our objective is to support it by maintaining a
favourable climate for business, but also to act directly with sectors that show promise in order
to help us grow. Our commitment has always been to favour inclusive growth, which supports a
variety of players whose local presence and vitality are major assets for Montréal, such as
cooperatives, local businesses or social economy enterprises.
More than ever, Montréal is becoming a place that promotes social economy, entrepreneurship and
innovation. The PME-MTL network, which we created in 2015, helped to create 3,000 businesses
the following year and funded more than 500. The new powers resulting from the law on the status
of metropolis will allow us to do much more.
The foundation of innovation is research and training. Montréal is recognized worldwide for the
quality of its institutions of higher education ; which is why we have set up a collaborative approach
with our universities and CEGEPs that will allow us to develop common projects while accentuating
the primary role of students and training in this new knowledge economy.
                                                                         17

4 ) CONTINUE FOR A SUSTAINABLE CITY AND MOBILITY
By signing the Paris Agreement in 2015, Montréal is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas
( GHG ) emissions by 80% by 2050. Given that the transport sector alone accounts for 41% of all
greenhouse gas, the achievement of these objectives inevitably involves a sustained effort in favour
of active and collective transport as well as the accelerated development of alternative solutions to
fossil fuels.
Montréal is a green city. Over the past few years, our goal of planting 300,000 trees by 2025 has
come up against a major enemy : the emerald ash borer. We had to double our efforts and invest
heavily in the treatment and slaughter of infested trees. As a result, 50,000 trees have been plant-
ed since 2012, despite the challenges of the emerald ash borer.
In addition, we are continuing our journey towards the «zero burial» objective of gradually reducing
waste destined for landfills. Since 2012, waste materials have decreased by 14%, while recovered
materials have increased by 11%. The collection of organic materials resulted in the recovery of
71,125 tonnes of materials, up 83% from 2012.
